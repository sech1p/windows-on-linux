# üíª Windows on Linux

This repository contains various guides on how to install Windows(-only) software on Linux which do not have their native version on Linux.

I also use this software on Linux, I can guarantee that it works as expected (or almost, depending on the software).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notice

This repository is no longer maintained as I switched to Windows 11. However, my guides are up-to-date and they still working.

Right now I use Ableton Live 12 (with jBridge for 32-bit legacy plugins support) and Photoshop 2025. But in nearly future I will do Photoshop 2025 install tutorial on Linux for sure.

My journey with daily driving Linux it's finished.
